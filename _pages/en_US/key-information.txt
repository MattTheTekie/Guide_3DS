If this is your first time working with emulators (or you're unfamiliar with technology), keep reading! Otherwise, if you have prior experience and know what you're doing, continue to [Get Started](get-started).
{: .notice--info}

This page covers some of the base computer terminology and emulator related-specific information that you should know before following this guide.

Each section is collapsed by default. Click or tap on the name of the section to open it.

## Things you should know about the progress of this emulator

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>Game compatibility</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/compatible.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

The emulator can run a few test samples, and can get to the loading screen of We Are Doomed. A compatibility table is in the works, and will likely arise when RPCSX is able to properly run commercial games.

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>Potential risks (Disclaimer)</strong></summary>

By modding your console, you subject it to the remote (but non-zero) possibility of the console being banned from online play or bricked (rendered non-functional). ___Incorrect file placement will NOT brick your console___, but purposely skipping instructions might. Similarly, the last ban wave occurred over five years ago, but there is no guarantee that another one will not occur in the future.

In short: Modding your console is safe, but it's ___your responsibility___ if something goes wrong.

## Things you need to do on your computer

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>Linux</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/sdroot.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}
You will **need** Linux to install the RPCSX emulator. The RPCSX emulator **will not** work on WSL. Until we progress enough in the development of the emulator this project **will be linux only.**

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>Downloading files from GitHub</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/github.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

In this guide, you will copy files that are downloaded on your computer/phone to your console's SD card. Many of these files come from GitHub, which is a website used by developers to publish their open-source releases. When downloading files from GitHub, you should download the file that *isn't* source code.

{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>Opening/extracting files</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/zipfiles.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

Some of the files that you will be asked to download come in the `.zip` file format, which is used to package multiple files into one file.

When you are told to "copy (file) from (file).zip", that means that you need to open (or "extract") the ZIP file. Inside the ZIP file will be the file you're looking for, after which you can copy it to the specified location on your SD card.

On most operating systems, you can extract files by double-clicking the file. If this doesn't work, you can install a reputable third-party extraction tool like [7-zip](https://7-zip.org/) instead.

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>(Windows only) File extensions</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/fileext.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

If your computer is running Windows, file extensions may be hidden by default, which may make it harder to find the files you're looking for. To enable file extensions, follow [these instructions](file-extensions-(windows)).
