If this is your first time working with emulators (or you're unfamiliar with technology), keep reading! Otherwise, if you have prior experience and know what you're doing, continue to [Get Started](get-started).
{: .notice--info}

This page covers some of the base computer terminology and emulator related-specific information that you should know before following this guide.

Each section is collapsed by default. Click or tap on the name of the section to open it.

## Things you should know about the progress of this emulator

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>Game compatibility</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/compatible.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

The emulator can run a few test samples, and can get to the loading screen of `We Are Doomed`. A compatibility table is in the works, and will likely arise when RPCSX is able to properly run commercial games.

## Things you need on your computer

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>Linux</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/sdroot.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}
You will **need** Linux to install the RPCSX emulator. The RPCSX emulator **will not** work on WSL. Until we progress enough in the development of the emulator this project **will be Linux only.**
